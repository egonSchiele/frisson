# Chisel

Chisel is an open source writing app. It comes with whisper.cpp and llama.cpp built in, so you can run AI models locally. You can also use the OpenAI API with an API key. All data stays local and private. Here is a quick demo video:

To get Chisel, just download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/egonSchiele/chisel/releases/tag/v0.3.1).

Chisel currently only works on Macs with the `arm64` architecture. If you have an M1 chip, the app will work for you. 

If you're not sure, here's how to check: Click on the Apple icon on the top left, click on About This Mac, and then see what it says for chip. Mine says "Apple M1 Max".

To run a model locally, you will need a model in the ggml format. You can look for models in these places:

## Chisel may be for you if...
- You're writing a book and want a free alternative to Scrivener.
- You'd like to try using AI to help edit your work.
- You want better speech-to-text results than what Apple has built in. 
- You have wanted to organize your chapters into blocks.
